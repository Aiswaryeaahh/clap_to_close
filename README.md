# Clap to Close üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Aiswarya V S

### Project Description
It is a web app that closes pop-ups when the system detects a clap or a sharp voice. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Rather than casually closing pop-up ads, I came up with this idea. 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
I replaced a mouse click with a clap..Why go casual when you can go extra?!
